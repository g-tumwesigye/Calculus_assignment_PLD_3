We wrote a function to calculate the derivative of a given f(x). It was tested with an equation.
Then we plotted the graph of the equation, identified the minimas and maximas. From which we computed the Global maxima and global minima.
Lastly we visualized the global maxima and minima and found the area.

ERRORS & CHALLENGES FACED:
1. Geofrey faced errors with parameter passing while creating the python function that calculates the derivative. We had to do mutliple tests to find out what works.

2. Marion while running. It was a typo that we had to trace for a while on a google meet.

3. We had issues trying to edit the collab doc at the same time which crashed multiple times. We had to overcome this by doing better version control.
